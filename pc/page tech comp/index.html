                         ThinkStation P520c is a compact, single-processor tower workstation that balances performance and affordability for professional applications such as CAD, 3D modeling, and content creation. It uses Intel Xeon W-series processors and NVIDIA Quadro graphics in a smaller 25L chassis compared to the full P520 model.

                       Portability: The main selling point was its compact, cube-like design with an integrated handle, making it easier to transport than a traditional desktop tower.
Performance: Reviewers found that models with higher-end components (Core i7 and GTX 1070) offered solid 1080p and even entry-level 4K gaming performance. The base models (Core i3, GTX 1050 Ti) required adjusting game settings to run smoothly above 30 frames per second.
Upgradeability: The system has easy-access panels for upgrading RAM (two DIMM slots) and storage (2.5" and 3.5" bays available), but limited space for larger components.
