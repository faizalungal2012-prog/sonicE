                        Legion Y720 Cube (also known as the IdeaCentre Y720 Cube) is a compact, portable gaming desktop PC that was released around 2017. It was designed to offer a console-like experience with easy portability via an integrated handle, making it suitable for LAN parties or multi-room use.

                       Portability: The main selling point was its compact, cube-like design with an integrated handle, making it easier to transport than a traditional desktop tower.
Performance: Reviewers found that models with higher-end components (Core i7 and GTX 1070) offered solid 1080p and even entry-level 4K gaming performance. The base models (Core i3, GTX 1050 Ti) required adjusting game settings to run smoothly above 30 frames per second.
Upgradeability: The system has easy-access panels for upgrading RAM (two DIMM slots) and storage (2.5" and 3.5" bays available), but limited space for larger components.
